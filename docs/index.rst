**Example generated project:** `https://github.com/fastapi-mvc/example <https://github.com/fastapi-mvc/example>`__

--------------

Fastapi-mvc is a developer productivity tool for `FastAPI <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`__ web framework.
It is designed to make programming `FastAPI <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`__ applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started.
It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more. Core features:

* Generated project Based on MVC architectural pattern
* WSGI + ASGI production server
* Generated project comes with docstrings and 100% unit tests coverage
* Kubernetes deployment with Redis HA cluster
* Makefile, GitHub actions and utilities
* Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment
* Dockerfile with K8s and cloud in mind
* Generate pieces of code or even your own generators
* Uses `Poetry <https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry>`__ dependency management
* Reproducible development environment using Vagrant or Nix

Fastapi-mvc comes with a number of scripts called generators that are designed to make your development life easier by creating everything that's necessary to start working on a particular task.
One of these is the new application generator, which will provide you with the foundation of a fresh `FastAPI <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`__ application so that you don't have to write it yourself.

Creating a new project is as easy as:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fastapi-mvc new /tmp/galactic-empire

This will create a fastapi-mvc project called galactic-empire in a ``/tmp/galactic-empire`` directory and install its dependencies using ``make install``.

Once project is generated and installed lets run development uvicorn server (ASGI):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /tmp/galactic-empire
    $ fastapi-mvc run
    [INFO] Executing shell command: ['/home/demo/.poetry/bin/poetry', 'install', '--no-interaction']
    Installing dependencies from lock file

    No dependencies to install or update

    Installing the current project: galactic-empire (0.1.0)
    [INFO] Executing shell command: ['/home/demo/.poetry/bin/poetry', 'run', 'uvicorn', '--host', '127.0.0.1', '--port', '8000', '--reload', 'galactic_empire.app.asgi:application']
    INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/tmp/galactic-empire']
    INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    INFO:     Started reloader process [4713] using watchgod
    INFO:     Started server process [4716]
    INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
    INFO:     Application startup complete.

To confirm it's actually working:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl 127.0.0.1:8000/api/ready
    {"status":"ok"}

Now let's add new API endpoints. For that we need to generate new controller:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fastapi-mvc generate controller death_star status load:post fire:delete

And then test generated controller endpoints:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl 127.0.0.1:8000/api/death_star/status
    {"hello":"world"}
    $ curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:8000/api/death_star/load
    {"hello":"world"}
    $ curl -X DELETE 127.0.0.1:8000/api/death_star/fire
    {"hello":"world"}

You will also see it in server logs:

.. code-block:: bash

    INFO:     127.0.0.1:47284 - "GET /api/ready HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    INFO:     127.0.0.1:55648 - "GET /api/death_star/status HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    INFO:     127.0.0.1:55650 - "POST /api/death_star/load HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    INFO:     127.0.0.1:55652 - "DELETE /api/death_star/fire HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

You can get the project directly from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install fastapi-mvc
