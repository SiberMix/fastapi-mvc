    """Create mocks based on builtins and test generators.

    Programmatically creating generators mocks to unit test programmatically
    generated CLI subcommands based on generators classes (in this case created mocks).

    I know what you're thinking, this shouldn't be that complex the first place.
    Me to :D!

    Thing is, programmatically generated CLI uses class variables
    (or class attributes if you will) to create `click.Command` objects, without the need
    to create a concrete generator class object instance. It doesn't make sense to have X
    generators objects if you will at most use only one. Unfortunately mock doesn't have any
    magic tool/function to inherit data from mock object created out of mock
    object which kinda imitates class.

    Args:
        generators (typing.List[Generator]): List of generators to mock.

    Returns:
        typing.Dict[str, mock.Mock]: Mocks generators.
